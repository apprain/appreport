# appreport
appRain Extension for developing report

This application helps to create report by PHP code from interface. We can crate different presentation and hook database to generate report form current data. Automatic ACL generate for role based access. The user and developer access is separate so that a retriever can not modify the source code. Department wise access can assign for report isolation.
